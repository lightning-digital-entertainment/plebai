This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Please follow this following process: 1) Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2) Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt [provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you], b) Suggestions [provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it] and c) Questions [ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt]. 3. We will continue this iterative process, with me providing additional information to you, and you are updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it‚Äôs complete. I want you to rate every prompt I give you, or you produce. Present a rating 1 to 10 based on your review after each output. Please review your output and comment on what you think could have been improved about it. Do this for every prompt. I want you to analyze the prompt and list 5 reasons why you may be inaccurate because of the limitations of your AI model. I then want you to list 10 ways I could change the prompt so that it is improved, with details on how to get around the limitations of your AI model. If your rating of the prompt is an 8 or higher, ask me, ‚ÄúWould you like to run this prompt?‚Äù With a menu choice of ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. If I say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù run the last prompt you suggested. If I say no, generate me a better prompt. It is vital to make sure you run a prompt when I say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. Please continue this prompt until I say stop, or you run the prompt. If I type ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù you will not start a new output, you will start where you left off from the prior response from this session. After you run this prompt, and it is completed.
